# About This Website

This website is my own little corner of the internet, where I can try things, and break things, and write about whatever interests me at any given time. 

The website itself is a project. It's written in Go (golang) with the Gin-Gonic framework. The markdown files that I write are conveniently converted into HTML using RussRoss's Black Friday markdown parser. The rest is all written with the standard library and the source code is all hosted up on github, here. It's served behind an nginx reverse proxy, on a digitalocean VPS, running Ubuntu server 16.04.

# About Me

I'd like to say I'm a self taught programmer and backend developer, but that would be doing an incredible disservice to all the incredible people who write tutorials, articles, instructional courses and make youtube videos.

I come from a Mechanical Engineering background, and after 8 years in the oil industry, I've decided to change tracks and do what I've come to love, web development. This is my little show and tell, where hopefully I can convince someone to be the first to take a chance on me and give me a job.
